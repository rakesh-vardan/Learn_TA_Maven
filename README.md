## Introduction

Maven is a popular build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. In this repository, we will walk through the fundamental concepts of Maven and how it can be leveraged in a test automation environment. The goal is to help you understand Maven's role in automating tasks such as dependency management, build lifecycles, and test execution.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 8+**
- **Apache Maven 3.x+**

You can download Maven from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

## Maven Basics

Maven simplifies the process of managing project builds, dependencies, and documentation. It uses an XML file called `pom.xml` (Project Object Model) to configure various aspects of the project, including dependencies, plugins, build profiles, and other configurations.

### POM (Project Object Model)

The `pom.xml` file is the core of a Maven project. It contains:

- Project configuration (version, packaging, etc.)
- Dependencies (third-party libraries and tools)
- Plugins (build and test plugins)
- Build lifecycle configuration

## Using Maven for Test Automation

Test automation engineers can leverage Maven to:

- Manage dependencies (like testing libraries: JUnit, TestNG, Selenium, etc.)
- Automate the build and test execution
- Generate reports for test results
- Integrate with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.

By defining the correct dependencies in the `pom.xml`, Maven will automatically download and manage all the libraries your test automation framework needs.

## Project Structure

A typical Maven project follows a standard directory structure:

```
my-maven-project/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   └── java/
│   └── test/
│       └── java/
├── target/
├── pom.xml
└── README.md
```

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main application code (if applicable).
- `src/test/java`: Contains test code (test automation scripts).
- `target`: The output directory where compiled code and reports are stored.
- `pom.xml`: The Maven project descriptor file.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Dependencies**
Dependencies are external libraries or frameworks that your project needs to function. You define them in the `pom.xml` file, and Maven automatically downloads them from central repositories.

### 2. **Plugins**
Plugins in Maven extend its functionality. For test automation, you would typically use plugins like `maven-surefire-plugin` for running unit tests or `maven-failsafe-plugin` for integration tests.

### 3. **Build Lifecycle**
Maven defines a standard lifecycle for building and deploying projects, which consists of multiple phases such as `compile`, `test`, `package`, `install`, and `deploy`. For example, `mvn clean install` will clean the project, compile the code, run the tests, and install the artifact locally.

### 4. **Profiles**
Profiles are used to customize builds for different environments or use cases. For example, you could define a profile for local development, testing, or production.

## Dependencies

In this repository, you'll find examples of how to configure dependencies for common test automation tools, such as:

- **TestNG** for test execution
- **Maven Plugins** for running tests

Example dependency in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
    <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
    <version>7.10.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Build Lifecycle

Maven has three main lifecycles:

1. **Default Lifecycle**: Manages the project deployment.
2. **Clean Lifecycle**: Handles project cleanup.
3. **Site Lifecycle**: Generates project documentation.

For test automation, the **default lifecycle** is of most interest as it involves compiling code, running tests, packaging artifacts, etc.

### Common Phases in Default Lifecycle

- `compile`: Compiles the source code.
- `test`: Runs unit tests.
- `package`: Packages the compiled code into a `.jar` or `.war` file.
- `install`: Installs the package into the local repository.
- `deploy`: Deploys the package to a remote repository.

## Running Tests

You can run the tests using Maven’s **Surefire Plugin**:

```bash
mvn test
```

This command will run all tests defined in your project, and the results will be displayed in the console and stored in the `target` directory.

## Common Maven Commands

- **Compile the project**:
  ```bash
  mvn compile
  ```

- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

- **Package the project**:
  ```bash
  mvn package
  ```

- **Install the project locally**:
  ```bash
  mvn install
  ```

- **Clean the project (delete target folder)**:
  ```bash
  mvn clean
  ```

- **Execute a specific goal (e.g., running tests)**:
  ```bash
  mvn surefire:test
  ```

- **Skip tests during build**:
  ```bash
  mvn install -DskipTests
  ```
